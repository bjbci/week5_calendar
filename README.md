# week5_calendar
##Why
I made this app to keep track of my houly appointments in a way that quickly lets me see upcoming times, current time and past times
## What did I learn
I learned how to use and adapt bbotstrap applications and how to use and manipulate moment.js to use in my apps.I learned how to use jQuery. I also learned how to use local storage to make data persist in my apps
### How is this different
This app is different because the blocks in the calendar change colors depending on if thee appointment is upcoming or past
####How do you use it
This app is used by deploying it in the web browser
